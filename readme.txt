1. input wav file
2. convert to signal 
3. filter 
4. nlp
5.output to txt file




each person should have different frequency range
-> differentiate people by fft sound signal and filter frequency [ don't know if this will work :( ] 
    => will use some kind of machine learning algo to do the seperation
    -> maybe too much overlap and cannot seperate signal if multiple person speak at same time
    -> also need filter out noise 
-> use nlp algo to transfer each person's sound to txt file
